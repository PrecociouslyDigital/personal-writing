### Introduction
*Put the Money in the Bag* is a game about unknowns, trust, and betrayal. As such, it requires someone with a bird's eye view of the situation

### Your job
Honestly, you kind of have the worst job. You have to plan, organize, and run this whole event, and you don't even get to play in it (your friends should probably treat you to dinner afterwards).

### The Stage
I've found that renting an office meeting room for a day on the weekend is the best way to play this game. Ideally find one with a sound system and webcam, so that you can monitor the game from an adjoining room and trigger events as necessary. Make sure the lighting is moody, and scatter some props (tools, medkits, nerf darts, and maybe some spare weapons) around the room in thematically appropriate places. Canned drinks and maybe snacks would be a plus (staying away from plastic bottles might help with mood). Be prepared to both call players (so get their numbers), and to play sound effects into the room. 
It can help if you hide a spare phone of some kind in the room so you can call it for additional tension as well.
#### Backstage
Ideally there's at least one area you can pull people to have ST conversations with and so that you can run the game.

#### Roles
At its core, *Put the Money in the Bag* is most interesting when not everyone can achieve their goals. It should be difficult to form a coalition that can resolve everything peacefully. As such, the following are a group of roles designed to come into conflict over the money in interesting ways. Much like the storyteller in a game like Blood on the Clocktower, you should pick roles that would work well together, but I recommend you randomize the role assignments, to avoid typecasting. Additionally, some roles have additional twists, which are events you can (and should) trigger for them if things appear to be going too smoothly for the players.

#### The Family Guy
Your character needs the money, but it isn't the most important thing to them. No the most important thing is their loving family and adorable, elementary-aged child, who have no idea what it is they do for a living.
##### The Twist
Your spouse called, and they forgot to pick up the birthday cake! You need to get out of here in the next half hour or you're really not going to make it.

#### The Informant
You're an undercover cop, and you're part of a mildly unsanctioned operation to catch these notorious criminals.
##### The twist
The heist went too well. You now need to delay the group for the whole two hours, which is when your backup can get here. 

#### The Mastermind
You're in it for the thrill of the game. Also because of your gambling debts, which are what you do to get the thrill of the game when you're not doing the game.
##### The Twist
At least two of these guys were supposed to die valiantly during the heist. An even split won't be enough to cover your debt; you were supposed to end up with half the take to go debt free. Now, at a minimum of a fourth of the take to not lose your kneecaps to the mob.

#### The Professional
For you, it's just business. You don't keep grudges and you don't take dumb risks.
##### The Twist
In your spare time, you collect rare bills and coins. There are two *extremely* rare bills mixed in with the rest of the cash, marked with a tiny dot of ink. Either one of those bills is worth as much as the rest of the take, to the right buyer.

#### The Larper
You think all of this is a fun, immersive live-action heist roleplay. You are actually a mild-mannered accountant who has never broken a law in real life.
#### The Twist
You have finally realized that your fellow heisters might not be role-playing a heist after all. You got through the heist with some genuinely impressive improvisation under pressure and a whole lot of luck. You don't care about the money, you just want to go home and forget that all of this ever happened.
### The Game
1. Brief each player individually on the specifics of the heist they just went through, and hand them the "loot" that they picked up. Make sure they have all parts of their "loadout."
2. Send them into the room one at a time.
3. Watch and enjoy! If you're getting bored they're probably getting bored and it's a good idea to spike the tension with some external factors.
