> The heist is over. You did it. Even split 6 ways there's more than enough money to retire a different person, far far away from here. You've always wanted to try Boca Chica. All that's left to do is to count and split your haul with your compatriots in crime.

### Introduction
*Put the Money in the Bag* is a one day parlor larp about making crime pay, fairly. You play one of an intrepid group of thieves who have just pulled off the heist of a lifetime. All that's left is to count and sort the haul, and hopefully not kill each other over it.
### What you'll need
1. A free day
2. One pair of safety glasses
3. A cool outfit
4. A bag of some kind
5. A fully charged cell phone.
### What you'll get
Your DM should give you a **Character Sheet** that will have the basics of your **Archetype** and your **Role**.
#### Archetype
Your **Archetype** is what you *do* in your crew; maybe you drive, or you steal, or you hack, or hurt people. Your role will determine what gear and weapons you have when you go into the room. 
##### Role
Your **Role** is who you are *outside* your crew. It might contain people important to you, or circumstances you found yourself in, but most crucially it will have your motivation; why you're risking it all, and what you plan to do with your score. 
### How to Prepare
#### Your Character
Your **Archetype** and **Role** are your starting points; it's up to you to flesh out your character and make them feel alive. Spend some time thinking about who your character is. Why have they chosen this life of crime? How do they feel about what they've done? Who's important in their life? What are they planning to do with their money? I recommend sticking with a name you're familiar answering to, but feel free to come up with a different one, a spouse, a kid, a sick parent, etc. Communicate with your DM during this process!
### Your Outfit
Try to put together *some* kind of outfit for the occasion; it doesn't have to be expensive or intricate, but it should be plausibly something worn to do dangerous, violent, profitable things (think leather jackets and cheap suits). Most importantly, try to include eyewear in your outfit; eye protection will be required. Try to bring a container of some kind for your share of the loot. A small backpack or a large purse should be sufficient.
Think of this section as more of a guideline than a requirement; talk with your DM if you have any concerns or hardships surrounding getting an outfit together
### What to Expect
#### Before the Game
Your DM will likely have rented some kind of main meeting room with chairs and a table, and ideally will have an ancillary room where they will be running the game. When you arrive, they'll bring you into the ancillary room, ensure you have all the equipment on your sheet, give you a brief description of what happened to you during the heist, and provide you with the "loot" you picked up. They'll then give you a moment to get into character before sending you into the main meeting room.
#### Starting the Game
Game is "on" when you enter the meeting room. Try to stay in character, and don't feel obligated to wait for everyone to get into the room before you start sorting the loot, or beginning your schemes.
#### Playing the Game
While game is "on", you should roleplay the character you have created. and try to achieve the goals that have been outlined for you by your DM (but remember, it is usually very hard to achieve your goals if you're shot!). In general, escalations to violence or its threat should be *precedented,* meaning that such escalations should be preceded by various social/roleplay escalations or at least a plausible *casus belli*. It isn't fun for anyone if we all shoot each other in the first fifteen minutes! If you ever feel that you don't have anything to do, offer to help with the process of sorting and counting; it's likely something that your character would want to be involved with, either to make sure that they're not being cheated or simply to make the work go faster so they can go home. Other activities to do may be to discuss the heist with your fellow heisters, monitor the police response, or simply relax and consume snacks.
##### Physical Roleplay
Please do not touch anyone without their explicit consent. The rules for combat do not require any spontaneous physical contact. Consent may be established before the game begins, or via "ooc" statements during the game. Consent to physical roleplay may be dropped at any point during the game as well via "ooc."
##### OOC
At times players may need to make a statement "out of character," potentially to clarify or communicate a boundary, describe something their character has done that would be difficult to roleplay, or to clarify a rule or what has just occurred. In such cases, players speaking "out of character" should cross their fingers in a manner visible to all other players to signal that they are being themselves and not their character temporarily.
##### Digital Roleplay
One of the highly recommended items is a fully charged phone. This phone will become your character's line to the outside world, via your DM; you may receive messages from NPCs, or receive news alerts. Additionally, your characters will have the ability to digitally message one another, for "private" communication. This could be how you set up alliances or betrayals.

**Note:** There will be a discord server set up for character-to-character communication. Please use the channels in the server for all such communication, since certain characters may have powers that reveal information about your communications.
#### Ending the Game
The game ends when all players have either achieved the objective outlined in their **Role** and left the room, or died. 
#### Combat rules
Combat in this game should always be a credible threat but an expensive proposition. Players can engage with combat in one of three ways: via nerf-dart, lightest touch with foam boffer, or called power. 

Valid hit areas are the entire body except the head, groin, and hands; Do not count any hits to these areas.

Getting hit in a limb with either a boffer or dart disables that limb, while getting hit in the body results in character death. Head hits will not count. Please try to avoid aiming for the head but we know it happens, so eye protection will be required (see **Safety** below) 
##### Nerf Dart
Nerf darts can be fired out of various nerf "blasters." This is the only valid way to deliver an attack with a nerf dart; throwing them or attempting to use them as a melee weapon will not count. Darts count as hits if the first thing they hit after having left the blaster is a valid hit location on a player. Legal dart hits to a limb **Disable** that limb, while legal dart hits to the body cause a character to begin **Dying**. 
##### Boffer
Boffers can be swung up to twice a second, and should be swung in an arc of at least 30 degrees. Any swing with a boffer that first touches a valid hit location (without first touching an invalid hit location or other weapon) counts as a hit. Fist boffers are solid black, and cannot be disarmed. All other boffers are weapon boffers and can be disarmed. Hits with a fist boffer to a limb disable that limb for 10 seconds, while hits with a fist boffer to the body put a player into the **Unconscious** state. Hits with a weapon boffer to a limb disable that limb, while hits with a weapon boffer to the body cause a character to begin **Dying**.
##### Powers
Players may gain Powers through their Archetype. Most powers are explained out of character when first used by a player (usually via crossing their fingers), but certain powers are used in combat without full explanation, and are listed below.
- Disarm: Touching a weapon with a boffer while calling "Disarm" forces that weapon to be dropped by the player currently holding it.
- Resist: Calling "resist" immediately after being hit negates the effects of that hit.
- A character with their hand in front of their face is "cloaked," and is by default not visible to any other character. They do continue to make sound that other characters can hear. Making any attack ends cloak.
##### Disablement, Dying and Unconsciousness
Disabling a limb means that that limb cannot be used. You cannot pick up or use objects with a disabled arm, and must safely drop any item you are currently holding. If one leg is disabled, you can only walk at a slower speed (roleplay a hobble and favor the leg that remains active), and cannot remain standing without supporting themselves . When both legs are disabled, you cannot move and must sit or lie in place.

Once you begin Dying, you may continue to act normally for 5 seconds, or until another hit would cause you to begin Dying. Once those 5 seconds are up or you take another hit that would cause you to begin Dying, you become Unconscious in addition to Dying. After one minute, if you are still Dying, you become Dead.

If you are Unconscious, you cannot move and are not aware of your surroundings while you are unconscious. Any character may spend 5 seconds "shaking you awake" from unconsciousness (please remember to get permission before actually touching or shaking anyone for this purpose).
#### Safety
Unlike our characters, Safety is our number one priority.

**Please make sure to keep your eye protection on at all times.** Your DM may have spares if you feel the need to take off your current eye protection for whatever reason; please feel free to find them and get it.

**Please feel free to disengage from the scene by leaving the room at any time.** If you do so, please try to check in with your DM if you can to let them know what's wrong so they can make sure everyone involved is safe and having a good time.

**Be aware that a hold may be called at any point** If you suspect that a situation is unsafe, call "hold" loudly and stop play until the issue is resolved. If you hear "hold" being called, you should stop play  as well and familiarize yourself with the source of the hold. Once the issue is resolved, the caller should confirm that everyone is ready to resume play, then say "game on" to resume.

**Please try to be respectful of the room and everyone involved**. If you're reading this, you're the first people to play this game, and I haven't had time to playtest and flesh out all the rules and edge cases and best practices. Please do your best to keep things respectful and fun, both towards the space, the DM, and your fellow players. Use your best judgement, and remember that we're all here to tell a compelling story and have fun, and not necessarily to "win."
