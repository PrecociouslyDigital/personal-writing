### Archetypes
#### Hacker
You're no script kiddie, you're a bona fide hacker; There's not a database on the net you can't sweet-talk your way into. 
##### Powers
- Sidearm: Standard six-shooter
- Read Message Metadata: You're able to see who is texting who (but not what they're writing)
- Kill Lights: You can send a message on your phone to kill the lights and make everyone blind for 5 seconds.
#### The Agent
You used to be a spy, until something drove you out of lying for your country and into lying for money. Maybe you were burned and betrayed by your old friends, or maybe you just became disillusioned with the work that they had you do. Either way, you're on your own now, with only your training and honed charms to help you fend for yourself.
##### Powers
- Sidearm: a **holdout**, which trades firepower for ease of concealment.
- You can **Disarm** others with a brawl boffer.
- What's that? You're a master of distraction: you can direct everyone's attention in a given direction for 5 seconds.
#### Medic
You have actual medical training, a rare commodity in the underworld, and it's up to you to patch everyone up after the plan goes inevitably wrong. 
##### Powers
- Sidearm: a **double-barrel shotgun**.
- Stabilize Dying: You can spend 60 seconds tending to a Dying character. While you do this, their Dying count is paused, and if you finish spending 60 seconds doing so, their Dying condition goes away.
- Repair Limb: You can spend 60 seconds tending to a disabled wound. If you are not interrupted, after 60 seconds that limb is no longer disabled.
#### Sniper
You're a sniper, a skilled marksman with the patience and precision needed to make those critical shots over long distances and short windows.
##### Powers
- Sidearm: a long **Sniper Rifle**
- Body Armor: You call **Resist** to all hits made to your body (but not your limbs).
#### Thief
Acrobatic and agile, there's no security system you can't bypass and no guard you can't sneak past.
##### Powers
- Sidearm: Standard six-shooter
- Optical Camouflage: You can **Cloak** yourself at any time by putting your hand in front of your face.
- Dodge: You may call **Resist** to a single attack that hits you.

### Roles
#### The Family Guy
Your character needs the money, but it isn't the most important thing to them. No the most important thing is their loving family and adorable, elementary-aged child, who have no idea what it is they do for a living.
##### The Twist
Your spouse called, and they forgot to pick up the birthday cake! You need to get out of here in the next half hour or you're really not going to make it.

#### The Informant
You're an undercover cop, and you're part of a mildly unsanctioned operation to catch these notorious criminals.
##### The twist
The heist went too well. You now need to delay the group for the whole two hours, which is when your backup can get here. 

#### The Mastermind
You're in it for the thrill of the game. Also because of your gambling debts, which are what you do to get the thrill of the game when you're not doing the game.
##### The Twist
At least two of these guys were supposed to die valiantly during the heist. An even split won't be enough to cover your debt; you were supposed to end up with half the take to go debt free. Now, at a minimum of a fourth of the take to not lose your kneecaps to the mob.

#### The Professional
For you, it's just business. You don't keep grudges and you don't take dumb risks. You're here to earn a lot of money, and go home and spend them on your various expensive hobbies and spoil your cat.
##### The Twist
In your spare time, you collect rare bills and coins. There are two *extremely* rare bills mixed in with the rest of the cash, marked with a tiny dot of ink. Either one of those bills is worth as much as the rest of the take, to the right buyer.

#### The Larper
You think all of this is a fun, immersive live-action heist roleplay. You are actually a mild-mannered accountant who has never broken a law in real life. You are, however, an excellent and resourceful role-player, so no one will discover your secret until it's too late.
#### The Twist
You have finally realized that your fellow heisters might not be role-playing a heist after all. You got through the heist with some genuinely impressive improvisation under pressure and a whole lot of luck. You don't care about the money, you just want to go home and forget that all of this ever happened.
