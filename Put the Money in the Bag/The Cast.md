### Roles
#### The Family Guy
Your character needs the money, but it isn't the most important thing to them. No the most important thing is their loving family and adorable, elementary-aged child, who have no idea what it is they do for a living.
##### The Twist
Your spouse called, and they forgot to pick up the birthday cake! You need to get out of here in the next half hour or you're really not going to make it.

#### The Informant
You're an undercover cop, and you're part of a mildly unsanctioned operation to catch these notorious criminals.
##### The twist
The heist went too well. You now need to delay the group for the whole two hours, which is when your backup can get here. 

#### The Mastermind
You're in it for the thrill of the game. Also because of your gambling debts, which are what you do to get the thrill of the game when you're not doing the game.
##### The Twist
At least two of these guys were supposed to die valiantly during the heist. An even split won't be enough to cover your debt; you were supposed to end up with half the take to go debt free. Now, at a minimum of a fourth of the take to not lose your kneecaps to the mob.

#### The Professional
For you, it's just business. You don't keep grudges and you don't take dumb risks.
##### The Twist
In your spare time, you collect rare bills and coins. There are two *extremely* rare bills mixed in with the rest of the cash, marked with a tiny dot of ink. Either one of those bills is worth as much as the rest of the take, to the right buyer.

#### The Larper
You think all of this is a fun, immersive live-action heist roleplay. You are actually a mild-mannered accountant who has never broken a law in real life.
#### The Twist
You have finally realized that your fellow heisters might not be role-playing a heist after all. You got through the heist with some genuinely impressive improvisation under pressure and a whole lot of luck. You don't care about the money, you just want to go home and forget that all of this ever happened.
