### Introduction
*Put the Money in the Bag* is a game about unknowns, trust, and betrayal. As such, it requires someone with a bird's eye view of the situation

### Your job
Honestly, you kind of have the worst job. You have to plan, organize, and run this whole event, and you don't even get to play in it (your friends should probably treat you to dinner afterwards).

### The Stage
I've found that renting an office meeting room for a day on the weekend is the best way to play this game. Ideally find one with a sound system and webcam, so that you can monitor the game from an adjoining room and trigger events as necessary. Make sure the lighting is moody, and scatter some props (tools, medkits, nerf darts, and maybe some spare weapons) around the room in thematically appropriate places. Canned drinks and maybe snacks would be a plus (staying away from plastic bottles might help with mood). Be prepared to both call players (so get their numbers), and to play sound effects into the room. 
It can help if you hide a spare phone of some kind in the room so you can call it for additional tension as well.
#### Backstage
Ideally there's at least one area you can pull people to have ST conversations with and so that you can run the game. 
### The Cast

#### Roles
At its core, *Put the Money in the Bag* is most interesting when not everyone can achieve their goals. It should be difficult to form a coalition that can resolve everything peacefully. As such, the following are a group of roles designed to come into conflict over the money in interesting ways. Much like the storyteller in a game like Blood on the Clocktower, you should pick roles that would work well together, but I recommend you randomize the role assignments, to avoid typecasting. Additionally, some roles have additional twists, which are events you can (and should) trigger for them if things appear to be going too smoothly for the players.

#### The Family Guy
Your character needs the money, but it isn't the most important thing to him. No the most important thing is their 
#### As they arrive
##### The Twist
Your ex-spouse called, and they forgot to pick up the birthday cake! You need to get out of here in the next half hour or you're really not going to make it.

### The Loot
Most critical is that you get several 

### The Game
1. Brief each player individually on the specifics of the heist they just went through, and hand them the "loot" that they picked up. Make sure they have all parts of their "loadout."
2. Send them into the room one at a time.
3. Watch and enjoy! If you're getting bored they're probably getting bored and it's a good idea to spike the tension with some external factors.
