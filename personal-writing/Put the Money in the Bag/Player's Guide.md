> The heist is over. You did it. Even split 6 ways there's more than enough money to retire a different person, far far away from here. You've always wanted to try Boca Chica. All that's left to do is to count and split your haul with your compatriots in crime.

### Introduction
*Put the Money in the Bag* is a one day parlor larp about making crime pay, fairly. You play one of an intrepid group of thieves who have just pulled off the heist of a lifetime. All that's left is to count and sort the haul, and hopefully not kill each other over it.
### What you'll need
1. A free day
2. One pair of safety glasses (ideally sunglasses)
3. A cool outfit
4. A bag of some kind
5. A fully charged cell phone.
### What you'll get
Your DM should give you a **Character Sheet** that will have the basics of your **Archetype** and your **Role**.
#### Archetype
Your **Archetype** is what you *do* in your crew; maybe you drive, or you steal, or you hack, or hurt people. Your role will determine what gear and weapons you have when you go into the room. 
##### Role
Your **Role** is who you are *outside* your crew. It might contain people important to you, or circumstances you found yourself in, but most crucially it will have your motivation; why you're risking it all, and what you plan to do with your score. 
### How to Prepare
#### Your Character
Your **Archetype** and **Role** are your starting points; it's up to you to flesh out your character and make them feel alive. Spend some time thinking about who your character is. Why have they chosen this life of crime? How do they feel about what they've done? Who's important in their life? What are they planning to do with their money? I recommend sticking with a name you're familiar answering to, but feel free to come up with a different one, a spouse, a kid, a sick parent, etc. Communicate with your DM during this process!
### Your Outfit
Try to put together *some* kind of outfit for the occasion; it doesn't have to be expensive or intricate, but it should be plausibly something worn to do dangerous, violent things (think leather jackets and cheap suits). Most importantly, try to include eyewear in your outfit; eye protection will be required. Try to bring a container of some kind for your share of the loot. A small backpack or a large purse should be sufficient.
Think of this section as more of a guideline than a requirement; talk with your DM if you have any concerns or hardships surrounding getting an outfit together
### What to Expect
Your DM will likely have rented some kind of main meeting room with chairs and a table, and ideally will have an ancillary room where they will be running the game. When you arrive, they'll bring you into the ancillary room, ensure you have all the equipment on your sheet, give you a brief description of what happened to you during the heist, and provide you with the "loot" you picked up. They'll then give you a moment to get into character before sending you into the main meeting room. Game is "on" when you enter the meeting room. Try to stay in character, and don't feel obligated to wait for everyone to get into the room before you start scheming.
#### Ending the Game
The game ends when all players have either achieved the objective outlined in their **Role** and left the room, or died. Tentatively, dinner after is planned, for storytime and feedback. 
#### Combat rules
Combat in this game should always be a credible threat but an expensive proposition. Players can engage with combat in one of two ways: via nerf-dart, or lightest touch with foam boffer.
#### Nerf Dart
Players will have access to 

Getting hit in a limb disables that limb, while getting hit in the body results in death. Head hits will not count. Please try to avoid aiming for the head but we know it happens, so eye protection will be required (see **Safety** below) 
#### Safety
Unlike our characters, Safety is our number one priority.

**Please make sure to keep your eye protection on at all times.** Your DM may have spares if you feel the need to take off your current eye protection for whatever reason; please feel free to find them and get it.

**Please feel free to disengage from the scene by leaving the room at any time.** If you do so, please try to check in with your DM if you can to let them know what's wrong so they can make sure everyone involved is safe and having a good time.

**Be aware that a hold may be called at any point** If you suspect that a situation is unsafe, call "hold" loudly and stop play until the issue is resolved. If you hear "hold" being called, you should stop play  as well and familiarize yourself with the source of the hold. Once the issue is resolved, the caller should confirm that everyone is ready to resume play, then say "game on" to resume.

**Please try to be respectful of the room and everyone involved**. If you're reading this, you're the first people to play this game, and I haven't had time to playtest and flesh out all the rules and edge cases and best practices. Please do your best to keep things respectful and fun, both towards the space, the DM, and your fellow players. Use your best judgement, and remember that we're all here to tell a compelling story and have fun, and not necessarily to "win."
